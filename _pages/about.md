I am currently a Post-Doc researcher in High Performance Computing, on the EuroCC project. My main research areas relate to (i) improving the scalability and performance of HPC scientific tools and applications of Minho Advanced Computing Center (MACC) industry partners, and (ii) configuring, managing, and utilising tools for the profiling, debugging, and visualisation of performance reports of parallel applications. I am also responsible for developing, assessing, and maintaining mechanisms for the collaboration with industry partners, focusing on coding best practices, transfer of know-how, as well as technological consulting with these partners.

I previously worked as a Software Engineer in the development of TopoSEM, a C++ software product by Electron SoftView for the SEM industry, whose release is emminent. Responsible for the implementation of several core functionalities related to data processing and image manipulation, as well as for the co-design and implementation of the UI. I am also responsible for the optimisation of key compute-intensive components of the product to ensure real-time user interaction with the application. I am also an invited assintant professor at the University of Minho, teaching both Bsc and Msc courses on Computing Systems, Computer Architectures, and Parallel Computing.

I obtained my PhD in 2019, awarded by the MAP Joint Doctoral Program on Informatics, where my research focusedon the development of automatic parallelization and scheduling strategies and tools for efficient resource usage of manycore, GPU, and multicore CPU devices for pipelined data streaming applications. I'm responsible for the development and maintenance of [HEP-Frame](https://bitbucket.org/ampereira/hep-frame/wiki/Home), a framework for the development and efficient execution of data analyses, which resulted from my PhD work.I was also involved in projects related to efficient implementation of Machine and Deep Learning solutions on GPUs and embedded systems for real-time classification. Through the research on these subjects I co-advised several Master Dissertations in conjunction with different research groups and BOSCH.

In 2011 I was awarded the Bsc in Informatics Engineering by the University of Minho, Portugal. During my Msc, I focused on High Performance Computing and Parallel Programming for homogeneous systems and heterogeneous systems with accelerators. After the first year of the Msc I had the opportunity to go on an internship at the University of Texas at Austin, working on the Computational Visualization Center at ICES, parallelizing a molecular docking application.
