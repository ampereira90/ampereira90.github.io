## HEP-Frame

HEP-Frame is a framework to aid the development and efficient execution of pipelined data analysis applications in homogeneous and heterogeneous servers. This tool resulted from the work developed during my PhD, and is currently actively used in particle physics research. <br />
 <br />
Access HEP-Frame [here](https://bitbucket.org/ampereira/hep-frame/wiki/Home).

## PRNG-Broker

PRNG-Broker is a middle layer between the application code, e.g., a Monte Carlo simulation, and specialised pseudo-random number generation (PRNG) libraries. It efficiently manages parallel PRN requests to external PRNG libraries, adequately using the computational resources available in multicore, manycore, and GPU devices. This efficient management of PRN generation focus on improving the performance of parallel compute-bound applications, but also provides a significantbenefit for both sequential and memory-bound codes. <br />
